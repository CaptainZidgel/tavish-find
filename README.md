# Tavish Find
Find matching STV demos on demos.tf for your POV demos.  \
You will need a binary of Icewind's Rust [demo parser](https://github.com/demostf/parser/)  \
Place the absolute path to the binary in a tavish.cfg file at the same level as your cli.py  \

This is highly experimental and isn't guaranteed to work. You will either not get a result or you will get a result that isn't right. I anticipate it will work best with PREC demos, as most of the failed responses can be chalked up to SOAP shenanigans.

Special thanks to Icewind for answering my questions (and writing demos.tf, of course).
